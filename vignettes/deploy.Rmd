This vignette describes the process of deployment, how you get your hugodown website off your local computer and on to the internet for everyone to see. The easiest workflow for most people is to use [netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I'll describe this process is details, and then give a few pointers for other approahes.

(I assume you're already familiar with the basics of Git and GitHub. If you're not, you may need to start with [Happy Git and GitHub for the R user](http://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan.)

## Netlify

(Adapted from [A Spoonful of Hugo: The netlify.toml File](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/#deploy-in-netlify) by Alison Hill, with permission.)

First, create an account if you don't already have one:

1.  Navigate to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and click on the *Sign Up* link.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
    knitr::include_graphics("netlify-landing.png")
    ```

2.  Sign up with *GitHub* to connect your GitHub and Netlify accounts.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
    knitr::include_graphics("netlify-sign-up.png")
    ```

    If you use a different version control service, select GitLab or BitBucket instead.

Next create a netlify site for your GitHub repo:

1.  On the netlify website, go *New Site from Git* and pick your repo. You'll be prompted to fill in these fields. They are probably already filled in correctly for you:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
    knitr::include_graphics("netlify-deploy-settings.png")
    ```

    Leave the advanced settings as is, and click deploy site. (This won't work but we'll fix it momentarily.)

Finally, configure your blog with `netlify.toml`. This prevents the biggest source of pain when deploying with netlify: version mismatches.

1.  Check you have a `_hugodown.yaml` file that contains `hugo_version: 0.66.0` or similar. It's added automatically you created your site with a hugodown helper; you'll need to add it yourself if you've created the site another way.

2.  Run `hugodown::use_netlify_toml()`, check the new `netlify.toml` in, commit, and push to Github.

Now return to [netlify](https://app.netlify.com), and look in the deploy log. You should see entries like:

    10:00:42 PM: Build ready to start
    10:00:43 PM: build-image version: 8e315e54bc4032a32e73290be556cde4f8348c12
    ...
    10:00:56 PM: Found netlify.toml. Overriding site configuration
    ...
    10:01:02 PM: Installing Hugo 0.68.3
    10:01:02 PM: Hugo Static Site Generator v0.68.3-157669A0 linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-03-24T12:05:34Z
    ...
    10:01:04 PM: Executing user command: hugo
    10:01:04 PM: Building sites …
    ...
    10:01:23 PM: Site is live

Success!

## Other options

### RStudio connect

For most site, `rmarkdown::publish_site()` should just work.

If you deploy your site this way, and it doesn't look quite right (e.g. missing style sheets) it's likely because the theme you're using requires a `baseURL`. In this case, you'll need to update your `config.toml` with the URL for your site and republish.

### GitHub pages

You'll need to make a few changes to your site:

-   Run `file.create("static/.nojekyll")`. This ensures that GitHub pages knows that you're using a regular HTML website, not a jekyll website (jekyll is GitHub's own blogging system).

-   If you have a custom domain name, create a `static/CNAME` file containing your domain name (e.g. just `tidyverse.org`, not `https://tidyverse.org`). Note that setting a custom domain name in the admin settings on your GitHub repo will not work.

-   Make sure to set `baseURL` in your `config.toml`
