hugodown is an experimental package that aims to facilitate the use of [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [hugo](http://gohugo.io/) together. It's similar to [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), but is focussed purely on Hugo websites, and enforces a stricter partitioning of roles: hugodown is responsible for transforming `.Rmd` to `.md`, and hugo is responsible for transforming `.md` to `.html`.

## Compared to blogdown

* It only re-runs your R code when you explicitly ask for it (by knitting the 
  post). This makes hugodown considerably easier to use for long-running blogs 
  and blogs with multiple contributors. 
  
* Local previews are pinned to a specific version of hugo. This makes it easier
  to work with multiple blogs, and protects your from hugo <-> theme 
  version incompatibilities.
  
* It provides support for getting started with a limited number of themes,
  automatically making needed tweaks to ensure that html widgets, syntax 
  highlighting, and math display work out of the box.

* It is more opinonated about hugo configuration; see `vignette("config")` 
  for details.

Otherwise, it strives to provide the best of blogdown's [two Rmarkdown variants](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html): `.Rmd` and `.Rmarkdown`. 

| Feature               | hugodown `.Rmd` | blogdown `.Rmd` | blogdown `.Rmarkdown` |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Output                | `.md`           | `.html`         | `.markdown`           |
| Runs R code           | y               | y               | y                     |
| Table of contents     | y               | n               | y                     |
| Bibliography          | y               | y               | n                     |
| MathJax               | y               | y               | ?                     |
| HTML widgets          | y               | y               | n                     |
| Cross-references      | n               | y               | y                     |

The only current limitation is that it does not support within page cross-references to figures, tables, and equations.

## Installation

hugodown isn't available from CRAN yet (and might never be), but you can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("r-lib/hugodown")
```

## Usage

The key to using hugodown is to put `output: hugodown::md_document()` in the YAML metadata of your `.Rmd` files. Then knitting the file will generate a `.md` file designed to work well with hugo. The rest of hugodown just makes your life a little easier:

* `hugo_start()` will automatically start a hugo server in the background,
  automatically previewing your site as you update it.

* `use_post()` will create a new post (filling in default content from
  the hugo [archetype](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/)).
  
* To knit an `.Rmd` post, you can use the Knit button to knit to the correct output format. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows/Linux).
  
* `site_outdated()` lists all `.Rmd` files that need to be re-rendered 
  (i.e. they have changed since the last time their `.md` was rendered).
  
With hugodown, knitting an individual post and building the site are two separate processes. A good workflow when working with an existing Hugo site in RStudio is to open the site's `.Rproj` file, use `hugo_start()`, then add or edit your posts. Because the hugo server will only add `.Rmd` content to your site preview after knitting, you'll need to use the keyboard shortcut to knit first.

### Citations

To use citations in a blog post, just provide a `bibliography` in the YAML metadata. If you want to use footnotes for citations (a style that generally works well in blogs), you'll need to find a footnote style CSL file (e.g. [`chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl`][footnote-csl], and use the following YAML header.

```yaml
bibliography: refs.bib
suppress-bibliography: true
csl: chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl
```

## Converting from blogdown

* Make sure your post archetype has extension `.Rmd` and includes
  `output: hugodown::md_document` in the YAML. The post archetype
  should typically be `archetypes/blog/index.Rmd`.
  
* Delete `index.Rmd` from the root of your site.

* Ensure that hugo is configured as described in `vignette("config")`.
